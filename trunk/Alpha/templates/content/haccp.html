                        operation serving or selling food must have a system in 
                        place to target and ensure the safety of the food being 
                        served. The FDA has designated a system called <strong>HACCP 
                        (pronounced &quot;Hassip&quot;)</strong>, for <strong>Hazard 
                        Analysis and Critical Control Point</strong>. HACCP is 
                        a system made up of of 7 principles that form the framework 
                        of a written food safety program focusing on the food 
                        in your operation. Our course will teach you each of the 
                        7 principles, and how to systematically apply them in 
                        your operation, in order to control and guarantee the 
                        safety of all the food you serve.</p>

                        HACCP is a management system in which food safety is addressed 
                        through the analysis and control of biological, chemical, 
                        and physical hazards from raw material production, procurement 
                        and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption 
                        of the finished product. </span></p>
                      <p>HACCP is an effective and rational means of assuring 
                        food safety from harvest to consumption. Preventing problems 
                        from occurring is the paramount goal underlying any HACCP 
                        system. Seven basic principles are employed in the development 
                        of HACCP plans that meet the stated goal. These principles 
                        include hazard analysis, CCP identification, establishing 
                        critical limits, monitoring procedures, corrective actions, 
                        verification procedures, and record-keeping and documentation.</p>
                      <p>For a successful HACCP program to be properly implemented, 
                        management must be committed to a HACCP approach. A commitment 
                        by management will indicate an awareness of the benefits 
                        and costs of HACCP and include education and training 
                        of employees. Benefits, in addition to enhanced assurance 
                        of food safety, are better use of resources and timely 
                        response to problems.<br>
