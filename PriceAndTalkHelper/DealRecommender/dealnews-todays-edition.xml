That's the lowest total price we could find by $19. Note that the label on the back of this "cookie jar" reads "Not for food use. Food consumed from this vessel may be harmful." We suspect also that it's not for children to play with, touch, or look at very long. But what would you expect from such a villain? This hand-painted ceramic collectors' item measures 11-1/2" tall x 14" wide x 8-1/2" deep and ships with a display box.]]></description>
