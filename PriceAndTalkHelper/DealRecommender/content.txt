Travelocity - Fly to Hawaii from Only $360 Round Trip
I've looked and can't seem to find any deals around the $360 mark, BUT am finding quite a few deals for well under $500. That makes it equal to the fares the last time I looked seriously at Hawaii quite a while ago (think, before baggage fees, economic meltdown, greedy ceo's, etc.) What's interesting is that the lowest fares aren't even limited to the west coast as you'd think so for you folks who will be stuck in the winter snow in the coming months should definitely check it out.
